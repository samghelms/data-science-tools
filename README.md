# Data science tools

A monorepo for data science tools (under construction). 

I apologize in advance for the monorepo -- for now the components are not set up to be distributed.


# TODOS:

- kernel manager
- selecting kernels?
- creating new
- save outputs
- scrollable/expandable outputs
- way to select jupyter server to connect to
- jupyter nb extension
- electron app
- allow you to reload the same page
- open up the file explorer so that it is expanded to current folder (or last state)
- icons not showing up for jupyter notebooks
- add a built in terminal (this is really useful if there are file system operations not implemented with the gui)
- add some sort of file search to the finder
- rename and save functionality
- distribute as a jupyter extension
- allow adding folders
- make text input in kernel headers interactive - highlight the text when it matches the name of a kernel, give autocomplete options, provide decorators to show the kernel status.
- start kernels on execute if they aren't already running
- add new kernel option
- persist kernel info / app state
