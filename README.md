# Data science tools

A monorepo for data science tools (under construction). 

` `

# TODOS:

- Clean up outputs
- electron app
- open up the file explorer so that it is expanded to current folder (or last state)
- icons not showing up for jupyter notebooks
- add a built in terminal (this is really useful if there are file system operations not implemented with the gui)
- Create a terminal that can display rich outputs
- add some sort of file search to the finder
- rename and save functionality
- distribute as a jupyter extension
- allow adding folders
- make text input in kernel headers interactive - highlight the text when it matches the name of a kernel, give autocomplete options, provide decorators to show the kernel status.
- start kernels on execute if they aren't already running
- add new kernel option
- persist kernel info / app state
- Build an example that can run fully in the browser via iodide
- Build documentation using docz
- Look into integration with the theia ide
- R kernel
- SQL kernel (ODBC support - language server will have to come later)
