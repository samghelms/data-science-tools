# IMarkdown notebooks

Markdown notebooks for interactive computing. Like RMarkdown, but for many languages.

# TODOS:

- kernel manager
- selecting kernels?
- creating new
- save outputs
- scrollable/expandable outputs
- way to select jupyter server to connect to
- jupyter nb extension
- electron app
- allow you to reload the same page
- open up the file explorer so that it is expanded to current folder (or last state)
- icons not showing up for jupyter notebooks
- add a built in terminal (this is really useful if there are file system operations not implemented with the gui)
- add some sort of file search to the finder
- rename and save functionality
- distribute as a jupyter extension
- allow adding folders
